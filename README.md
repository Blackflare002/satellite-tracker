# Satellite Tracker App

Concordia Web Dev Bootcamp final, solo project. All code and styling done by me.

APIs used: api.spectator.earth, api.nasa.gov/neo.

This app showcases a variety of satellites and displays their current coordinates over Earth, as well as their name and NORAD I.D. It also shows a list of Near Earth Objects (asteroids) detected on the current date. The frontend is built in React, with CSS styling through styled-components, and data is fetched from two separate external REST APIs. The comments functionality and user login functionality are handled by Node, Express and MongoDB.
